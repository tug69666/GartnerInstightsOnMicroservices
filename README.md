# Gartner Instights On Microservices

    After reading the Gartner document about microservices, I agree with Gartner about his thoughts on microservices 
as well as miniservices and macroservices. Microservices is a great system to have compared to something like a macroservice 
because when there's a macroservice, every process is under one service which isn't the best case to go about it. If a 
mistake has been made, the whole macroservice will easily be affected which isn't good when it comes to a company trying 
to maintain a product.

    Aside from macroservices being cheaper to maintain compared to microservices and after talking about the number of 
advantages microservices has over macroservices, it seems like microservices are the way to go but comparing microservices 
to miniservices is a different situation. Miniservices are similar to microservices in that there's more than one service 
maintaining a product but other than that, the advantages of miniservices outweigh microservices. Some of the advantages 
include miniservices being cheaper to maintain, miniservices being able to share its data like libraries and databases 
while microservices can't really do that and instead owns its data, and communication between microservices have a higher 
chance for failure compared to miniservices. Miniservices seems like a great in between to microservices that have many 
services and macroservices that have only one service.
